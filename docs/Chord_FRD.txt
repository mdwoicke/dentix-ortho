Scheduling Guidelines
Ortho – age 7 - 20
We do not offer walk-ins, an appointment must be scheduled.
New Patient = Patient who has not been seen by any of our brands before, even if a child has not been seen in several years, they are not a new patient.
Ask probing questions
“Are you calling for general dentistry or orthodontics?”
“Have any of your children been to any of our offices before?”
“What kind of insurance does the child have?”
If the insurance provided is not in network, advise the caller that the insurance is not in network and treatment would not be covered under in-network benefits.
Parent / legal guardian must be present at the first appointment. If the legal guardian is not the parent, physical court documentation must be with them at the time of the visit.
New Patient Paperwork will be sent to their email on file. If they do not complete it prior to the appointment, they must arrive 20-30 minutes early to complete it in office.
Schedule siblings side-by-side when possible, no limit on number of siblings.
